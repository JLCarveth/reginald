I am excited to announce the release of version 1.0 of Nutty<sup>1</sup>, an HTTP paste server that allows for easy storage and sharing of plaintext files via a simple HTTP API.

With Nutty, you can self-host your own paste server and have complete control over your data. The software is easy to use and comes with a simple example bash client that encrypts all text before sending it to the server, ensuring the security of your data.

Whether you're looking to share code snippets with colleagues or store notes and ideas for personal use, Nutty makes it easy and convenient. Give it a try today and see how it can simplify your workflow!
